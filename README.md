## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. Check the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab for open tasks
2. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` if you're new
3. **Comment on the issue** to let others know you're working on it — please wait to be assigned before starting, to avoid duplicate work
4. If you have a new idea or found a bug not yet listed, open a new issue first to discuss it before submitting a PR

## 🌿 Branching & Commit Guidelines

- Never commit directly to `main`
- Create a descriptive branch for your work:
```bash
  git checkout -b fix/short-description
  # or
  git checkout -b feature/short-description
```
- Keep commits small and focused, with clear messages:

- ---

## 🔃 Pull Request Process

1. Push your branch to your fork:
```bash
   git push origin fix/short-description
```
2. Open a Pull Request against `5hivam123:main`
3. In your PR description, include:
   - What the change does
   - How you tested it
   - Link the related issue (e.g. `Fixes #1`)
4. Keep the PR **open** until it has been reviewed and merged (or you've been asked to close it) — please don't close PRs unilaterally
5. Respond to review comments by pushing more commits to the same branch — no need to open a new PR
6. A maintainer will review, request changes if needed, and merge once it's ready

## 🏷️ ECSoC Labeling Rules

This project participates in **Elite Coders Summer of Code (ECSoC) 2026**, scored automatically by **ECSoC Sentinel**.

- Every PR that should be scored **must carry the `ECSoC26` label** before or at the time of merging
- Difficulty labels (`ECSoC26-L1`, `ECSoC26-L2`, `ECSoC26-L3`) are assigned **automatically by Sentinel** after merge — contributors and maintainers should not add these manually
- Bonus XP labels (`good-issue`, `good-pr`, `good-ui`, `good-backend`) can only be added by Project Admins for contributions that go beyond the expected scope
- PRs without the `ECSoC26` label will **not** be scored, so make sure it's applied before your PR is merged

---

## 🎨 Code Style

- Follow existing naming conventions and file structure
- Keep functions focused and readable
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Test your changes locally before submitting (upload a sample PDF/DOCX and confirm the app behaves as expected)
